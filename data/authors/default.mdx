# Who am I?

I'm Kerry Wang. A 172cm black haired Chinese dude who was alived in 2002. I can speak English, and have retained a bit of Mandarin. I'm on track to graduate from the University of British Columbia in 2025 with a degree in Computer Engineering.

I'd describe myself as a naturally curious person. During my time about, I love finding seldom trodden paths, and quiet study spaces. I do my best to continuously learn new things, and I love to share my knowledge with others. 

I'd definately consider myself a overthinker. I'm often the bus or doing an exercise with no music and just lost in my thoughts. 

# What do I do?

## Solving Problems

I love solving problems with technical solutions. Whether it's:
- Using a graph to [visualize my university notes](https://interkonnection.vercel.app/)
- Computing the best team in Pokemon ROM hack called [Pokemon Unbound](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-unbound-completed.382178/)
- Help my mom [parse spreadsheets](https://worldofkerry.github.io/timesheet/) from work
- Building [transpilers between programming languages](https://github.com/worldofkerry/tohdl)

## Sweat & Repeat

I try to keep in shape, as I value being able to live a long and healthy life. Here are some of my favourites:
- Powerlifting: I love being able to track my progress!
- Biking: A mixture of mountain, gravel and pavement is the best!
    - I did a lot of [exploring](https://www.statshunters.com/share/c1bda21e9aae) around Greater Vancouver and Bay Area
- Running: The occasional treadmill run, or a jog up Burnaby Mountain!
- Badminton / Ping Pong: Great fun with friends!
- Volleyball: Played a bit when not in Vancouver, been wanting to get back into it.

My [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/66057941). Can you guess where I've lived?

## No Forkin' Around
I track how quickly I can speedrun cooking on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cookingspeedrun/).
- I cooked stir frys everyday when I lived in UBC residence
- I cooked soup / hot-pot stuff everyday when I lived in Calgary
- Am currently exploring baguettes and pizzas, as well as growing a sourdough starter

## Gamer Things
- My most played game on Steam is GTA V. Driving vehicles around is too much fun!
- A fan of Cities Skylines, to get at my transportation infrastructure itch
- RTS games are cool too: Starcraft has great cinematics, and Iron Marines has a great campaign
- I try to keep update to date with Yugioh as well, love the endless combo potential

## Motivated by Price
- I built my PC exclusively from used parts (except for the case fans)
- I [upgraded my bike](../life/bike-upgrade.mdx) using a shifter, derailleur, and cassette from Aliexpress

## Binge Watching
- Modern Family is the best show ever. Wholesome 100. Have watched it twice so far.
- I've watched good chunk of One Piece as well, love the Marineford Arc!

## Where have I been?

## Living
I was born in Shanghai moved to Burnaby when I was quite young. I went to UBC for my undergrad, and lived in residence for 2 years. I've lived in Calgary and Palo Alto for internships (12 and 4 months respectively).

I want to try living out of my car and do digital nomad things. I literally slept in the car 3 times the past few weeks just to test it out.

## Traveling
I've been to China (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and surrounding area) mostly for family or cultural purposes. I do want to go to Europe and maybe Japan, as their rail infrastructure is super cool. However, I think it might be a better idea to live there via working holiday or HPI visa. LA is also on my list, as I can then find all the landmarks from GTA V!

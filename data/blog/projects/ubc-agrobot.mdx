## Image recognition work for the UBC Agrobot Design Team

- Prepared and trained a plant health classifier with data augmentation in the background, with another
  team member — trained on web scraped leaf images
- Completed a wheat head detector utilizing TensorFlow Object Detection API and transfer learning for Edge TPU deployment–with mAP of .84 on the validation set
- Implemented a leaf health classifier with hough line and circle transform
- Working with Intel Realsense to get leaf surface area computations for biomass estimation

# Results

## Wheat Head Detector

Trained on google colab, using tensorflow 2 for edge devices. Uses transfer learning based on SSD Mobilenet.

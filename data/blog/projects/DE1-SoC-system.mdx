# Project Components

## Implemented Modules

- Hardware accelerated the 7-seg displays to use hardware for the division and modulo operations
- Used hardware interrupts and software to controls LED brightness using PWM
- Implemented an efficient prime number generator in software
- Used FreeRTOS to create a multi-threaded system, to control the 7-seg displays and LED brightness
  {/* - Ran the embedded linux on the Cortex A9 processor, and have it interface with the FPGA and peripherals */}

C/C++ and HDL code can be provided upon request, due to course policies.

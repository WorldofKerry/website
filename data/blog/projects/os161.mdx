# Summary

Creating an operating system for the MIPS architecture

## Key Takeaways

- Implementing synchronization primatives (locks, sempahores, condition variables)
- Enforce mutual exclusion and thread-to-thread signaling
- Implementing file system calls, safe transport between user and kernel space, and virtual file system interface
- Implementing multi-processing through process system calls
- Implementing virtual memory, TLB faults, virtual address spaces, page tables and paging to disk

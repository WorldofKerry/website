# What am I?

I'm Kerry Wang. I'm a 172cm black haired Chinese dude who kinda wants to get buff. Have never been able to get abs as I don't pay enough attention to my diet.

# Who am I?

I'd describe myself as a naturally curious personâ€”I love exploring hidden corners of UBC to discover the perfect study spot or quiet nook. That curiosity also turns inward; I tend to overthink, replaying past conversations or decisions long after the moment has passed. Sometimes it makes me a little introverted, since my mind is still processing while the world moves forward.

# What do I do?

## Solving Problems

I love solving problems with technical solutions. Whether it's:
- Using a graph to [visualize my university notes](https://interkonnection.vercel.app/)
- Computing the best team in Pokemon Unbound
- Help my mom [parse](https://worldofkerry.github.io/timesheet/) her spreadsheets from work
- Building transpilers for programming languages

## Moving the Body
- Powerlifting: I love being able to track my progress!
- Biking: A mixture of mountain, gravel and pavement is the best!
    - I did a lot of [exploring](https://www.statshunters.com/share/c1bda21e9aae) around Greater Vancouver and Bay Area
- Running: The occasional treadmill run, or a jog up Burnaby Mountain!
- Badminton: I play with my friends once in a while.
- Indoor/Beach Volleyball: Played a bit when not in Vancouver, been wanting to get back into it.

My [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/66057941). Try to guess where I live!

## Slurp Chomp Burp
I track how quickly I can speedrun cooking on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cookingspeedrun/).
- I cooked stir frys everyday when I lived in UBC residence
- I cooked soup / hot-pot stuff everyday when I lived in Calgary
- I explored baguettes and pizzas in early 2025 -- have also been growing my sourdough starter

## Gamer Things
- My most played game on steam is GTA V. Cars go vroom!
- Definately a bit fan of Cities Skylines -> huge transportation infrastructure nerd
- Starcraft has great cinematics, and Iron Marines has a great campaign
- Big Yugioh fan as well, love the endless combo potential

## Motivated by Price
- I built my PC exclusively from used parts (except for the fans)
- I [upgraded my bike](../life/bike-upgrade.mdx) using a shifter, derailleur, and cassette from Aliexpress

## Binge Watching
- Modern Family is the best show ever. Wholesome 100. Have watched it twice so far.
- I've watched good chunk of One Piece as well, love the Marineford Arc!

## Where have I been?

## Living
I was born in Shanghai moved to Burnaby when I was quite young. I went to UBC for my undergrad, and lived in residence for 2 years. I've lived in Calgary and Palo Alto for internships (12 and 4 months respectively).

I want to try living out of my car and do digital nomad things. I literally slept in the car 3 times the past few weeks just to test it out.

## Traveling
I'm not big on traveling. I've been to China (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and surrounding area) mostly for family or cultural purposes. I do want to go to Europe and maybe Japan, because I think their rail infrastructure is super cool. However, I think it might be a better idea to live there via working holiday or HPI visa. Visiting LA is also on my list, as I can find all the landmarks from GTA V.
